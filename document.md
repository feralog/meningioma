Meningiomas are some of the most prevalent primary brain tumors in adults, and
are typically non-neuroglial in nature. A variety of symptoms may be observed,
including headaches, ﬂuctuations in mental status, ataxia, muscle weakness,
nausea and vomiting, seizures, visual changes, speech disorders, and sensory
abnormalities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has a grading system for
meningiomas based on histological criteria, which is as follows: Grade 1
meningiomas are considered benign; Grade 2 meningiomas have a moderately
aggressive nature and usually present with histological atypia; and Grade 3
meningiomas exhibit aggressive malignant behavior. Grade 3 meningiomas are
distinguished by aberrant and accelerated cellular proliferation, which increases
the probability of invasion and recurrence within the central nervous system
relative to the other grades. Malignant meningiomas are further classiﬁed by
tumor size. For example, WHO grade 3 meningiomas with diameter >5 cm are
designated giant meningiomas. Giant meningiomas are complicated by their
potential for compression of the brain tissue, which can lead to increased
intracranial pressure and hemodynamic changes. In many cases, these
changes induce vasogenic edema in the adjacent brain tissue. This article
details a rare case of rapidly growing atypical giant meningioma that
progressed to an anterior-posterior diameter of 13 cm within 3 years,
occupying the majority of the left hemisphere of the brain and encroaching
upon the right intracranial structures. Through recent advances in medical
diagnostics and heightened public awareness of health issues, cases with such
large meningiomas have become exceedingly rare. Fortunately, the tumor in the
present case was successfully resected using advanced surgical techniques that
employed microscopy in conjunction with sodium ﬂuorescein, resulting in
complete removal of the tumor and restoration of the patient’s muscle
strength postoperatively. The value of ﬂuorescence-guided surgery in this type
of procedure is support in the present case report.

## Introduction
Meningiomas are the most prevalent intracranial neoplasms,
accounting for approximately 15% to 20% of all such cases (1, 2).
They are relatively slow-growing extra-axial tumors (3, 4), most
frequently observed in the convex, parasagittal, or sickle regions of
the skull, the pterygoid wings, the saddle nodes, and the posterior
cranial fossa. Based on their slow growth rate (5, 6), meningiomas
frequently remain undetected until they have reached a size that
causes clinical symptoms, particularly when they are located in the
“silent areas” of the brain. Meningiomas may be of considerable size
(>3 cm) or very large (>5 cm) at the time of diagnosis (7, 8). Giant
meningiomas can be distinguished from other types of
meningiomas by three key characteristics: their large size, the fact
that they can cause increased intracranial pressure, and their
proximity to critical anatomical structures. These tumors are
exceedingly rare and their characteristics frequently make them
challenging for surgeons to excise completely (9). In the present
case, the patient developed a large meningioma in the left
hemisphere that grew to a diameter of 13 cm during a 3-year
period. By employing sodium ﬂuorescein and microscope-assisted
techniques, we successfully achieved complete resection of the
tumor. In the postoperative period, the patient’s muscle strength
in the right upper extremity improved from grade 0 to grade III
following a cerebral infarction, while the muscle strength in the
right lower extremity improved from grade 0 to grade IV.
## Case presentation
A 77-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital on 19
March 2024 with chief complaints of dysphoria and unfavorable
speech that had been present for more than 1 month. Although the
symptoms were intermittent, they were persistently worsening and
accompanied by occasional headaches. The patient had a history of
a cerebral infarction. A cranial MRI conducted in 2021 (Figure 1)
did not reveal any obvious signs of an intracranial tumor. On
admission, a physical examination revealed Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) score of 11, incomplete motor aphasia, bilateral ocular
collapse, unresisted neck, voluntary movement of the left limbs,
and decreased muscle tone in the right limbs, with a muscle strength
of grade 0. Laboratory tests, including electrocardiogram and
routine blood and urine tests, yielded results within the normal
ranges. A cranial MRI (Figure 2A) revealed a large occupying lesion
(12.9×9.1×6.1 cm3) in the left cerebral hemisphere, invading the
superior sagittal sinus in the right intracranial area. Multiple
tortuous and increased vascular shadows were also observed in
the vicinity of the lesion. A diffusion tensor imaging examination
revealed that the projecting nerve bundles in the left frontal-parietal
lobe and corpus callosum area showed partial atrophy compared
with those on the contralateral side, with local irregularities
suggestive of damage caused by tumor inﬁltration. The
preoperative examination revealed a robust blood supply to the
tumor, accompanied by diminished visualization of the left internal

carotid artery system. Cerebral angiography was planned to identify
any cerebral vascular lesions and the blood supply to the tumor.
This was scheduled to be followed by a craniotomy at a later stage.
The patient underwent the cerebral angiography under general
anesthesia with embolization of the artery supplying blood to the
tumor. Postoperative medications were administered to prevent
complications, such as reduced intracranial pressure, and provide
neuroprotection and symptomatic support. On postoperative day 6,
the patient underwent ﬂuorescein sodium labeling microscopy
under general anesthesia to evaluate the extent of the resection in
the left frontoparietal lobe. During this procedure, the tumor was
visualized by sodium ﬂuorescein via the frontotemporal-parietal
approach over the midline (Figure 3A). A tumor measuring
approximately 13×11×6 cm3 was successfully resected
(Figure 3B), with the bilateral anterior cerebral arteries being
well-protected and uninjured. Intraoperative dynamic monitoring
of blood gas analysis revealed transfusion requirements for 11 units,
500 mL of plasma, and 10 units of cold precipitation. The patient’s
intraoperative blood pressure and heart rate remained stable,
the anesthesia was effective, and the patient was transferred back
to the neurosurgical intensive care unit under anesthesia. The
postoperative pathological examination (Figure 3C) revealed a
giant atypical meningioma (WHO grade 2). A review of the
postoperative cranial MRI revealed complete resection of the
tumor (Figure 2B). On postoperative day 3, the patient had a
GCS score of 9 and was able to perform simple verbal
communication, with intermittent handshake movements in the
left upper limb, grade III muscle strength in the left lower limb, and
stimulation of the right lower limb with slight ﬂexion. On
postoperative day 7, the patient developed a fever that reached
39°C. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal
ﬂuid culture revealed staphylococcus capitatus, indicating an
intracranial infection. Meanwhile, the lung infection showed signs
of worsening, and the patient was initiated on an escalating
antibiotic regimen, comprising intravenous vancomycin 1 g every
12 hours and meropenem 0.5 g every 8 hours. Subsequently, the
patient exhibited a rash, prompting the cessation of vancomycin
and initiation of oral linezolid therapy. On postoperative day 12, the
patient’s condition was characterized by severe intermittent fever,
lethargy, and grade IV muscle strength in the left limbs. The left
upper limb exhibited partial compliance with movement. The
muscle strength of the right upper limb was classiﬁed as grade I,
while that of the right lower limb was classiﬁed as grade III. After
receiving the family’s consent, lumbar large-pool tube drainage was
initiated. By postoperative day 20, the patient’s condition had
stabilized, with no further fever and a smooth course of lumbar
large-pool drainage. By postoperative day 48, the patient had made
a full recovery. Her mental status was clear, her spirits were high,
and her GCS score was 15. The muscle strength of the left limbs was
classiﬁed as grade V-, the muscle strength of the right upper limb
was classiﬁed as grade III (her muscle strength after the previous
cerebral infarction was classiﬁed as grade III), and the muscle
strength of the right lower limb was classiﬁed as grade IV. The
patient had a right Babinski sign of (±). The patient (Figure 4) was
discharged with instructions to continue rehabilitation,
supplemented by radiation therapy.

## Discussion
Meningiomas comprise 15% to 20% of intracranial tumors (1, 2).
The majority of these tumors are slow-growing and benign, while the
remainder are aggressive or truly malignant. The tumors are typically
situated in the subdural space and represent the most prevalent non-
glial primary tumors within the skull. It is crucial to acknowledge that
all brain tumors, irrespective of their pathological classiﬁcation, have
the potential to elicit severe or even fatal symptoms due to their mass
effect, a phenomenon exempliﬁed by meningiomas. Meningiomas
typically grow relatively slowly, with an average growth rate of
approximately 2.41 mm per year (5, 6). Consequently, meningiomas
rarely cause clinical symptoms in their early stages. However, as time
progresses, these tumors increase in size and begin to cause a range of
different symptoms. A standard deﬁnition for the diameter indicating a
giant meningioma remains to be established within the academic
community. Deﬁnitions vary, with some deﬁning diameters
exceeding 4.5 cm, others deﬁning diameters exceeding 5 cm, 6 cm,
or 7 cm (7, 8, 10–14), and the majority of the literature deﬁning
diameters exceeding 5 cm as giant meningiomas (9). In 1950, White
et al. (15) reported a meningioma weighing 1,353 g. In 1971, Rao et al.
(16) reported a meningioma weighing 1,890 g. In 1982, Cech et al. (17)
reported a meningioma with a maximum diameter of 22 cm. Finally, in
2002, Gutteridge and Wallace (18) reported a meningioma with a
maximum diameter of >10 cm. A review of the literature reveals that
meningiomas with very large diameters or large weights have been
observed in conjunction with cranial lesions or signiﬁcant extracranial
masses. In the present case, the meningioma was entirely conﬁned to
the skull, resulting in signiﬁcant compression of the brain tissue and a
grade 0 muscle strength rating for the right limbs. Furthermore, the
patient’s meningioma, which was absent on the previous MRI,
developed and grew to a diameter of 13 cm in only 3 years,
inconsistent with the conventional notion of a slow-growing
meningioma. Nevertheless, the precise biological mechanism by
which meningiomas attain such enormous sizes remains unclear.
Ultimately, the tumor in the present case was completely resected
using microscopy in conjunction with sodium ﬂuorescein. Following
the procedure, the patient’s muscle strength in the right upper limb was
restored from grade 0 to grade III, while that in the right lower limb
was restored from grade 0 to grade IV, indicating signiﬁcant
improvement. In the context of meningioma resection, identifying
the caudal border between the meningioma and the surrounding dura
mater represents a signiﬁcant challenge. Sodium ﬂuorescein, a
ﬂuorescent agent with an analogous mechanism of action to
gadolinium, a contrast-enhancing substance utilized in magnetic
resonance imaging, is capable of accumulating in regions where the
blood–brain barrier is compromised, particularly in the area
surrounding a tumor (19). By precisely controlling the injection time,
it is possible to ensure that sufﬁcient quantities of sodium ﬂuorescein
are ﬂushed out of healthy areas while being retained in areas with an
altered blood–brain barrier (20). This provides real-time ﬂuorescence
contrast during surgery, enabling neurosurgeons to identify tumor
areas with greater clarity. The technique can also mitigate the
shortcomings of conventional neuronavigation techniques, such as
brain displacement or localization inaccuracies, and allow
visualization of the contrast-enhanced tumor regions in real time
(21–25). In a study involving 30 patients with newly diagnosed or
recurrent meningiomas, 88% of the tumors exhibited homogeneous
diffuse enhancement with sodium ﬂuorescein, and the resection rate
was 87%. The present ﬁndings also indicate that ﬂuorescence-guided
neurosurgery may be a promising technique for extending the resection
of brain tumors. The use of sodium ﬂuorescein as an alternative to 5-
aminolevulinic acid addresses some of the limitations associated with
that reagent (26). Studies have demonstrated that sodium ﬂuorescein
can effectively delineate adjacent vascular and neural structures during
meningioma surgery, facilitating separation of the tumor from the
brain tissue. The technique enhances surgical safety, facilitates the
resection of complex vascularized meningiomas, and provides unique
advantages for the visualization of hidden vascular structures (27, 28).
In cases where meningiomas have a large blood supply, preoperative
embolization of the dural arteries may facilitate surgical resection and
reduce blood loss and complications (29–36). Nevertheless,
preoperative embolization remains a topic of contention, because it
has the potential to cause complications such as edema, hemorrhage,
stroke, and cerebral nerve palsy (37–39). These risks are more prevalent
in cases with large, highly vascularized meningiomas (40, 41), where
embolization remains a viable option because the supplying artery is
challenging to access. Therefore, the elevated risk of cerebral edema,
hemorrhage, and suboptimal discharge outcomes is not unexpected. It
has been reported (42) that embolization may have a negative impact
on WHO grade 2/3 tumors, although the ﬁndings may have been
affected by bias stemming from the fact that these tumors are large,
have abundant blood ﬂow, are challenging to resect, and are more likely
to undergo embolization. Conversely, it has been proposed that
embolization may diminish the likelihood of tumor recurrence and
could be a valuable alternative for patients at elevated risk for surgical
intervention (33, 40, 43–45). Furthermore, this ﬂuorescence-guided
surgical technique is particularly beneﬁcial for patients whose tumors
are located in nonverbal, sensory, motor, and cognitive regions (e.g.,
temporal and occipital lobes) and does not increase the incidence of
postoperative complications. Moreover, the technique can minimize
the probability of postoperative recurrence and does not impose an
additional ﬁnancial burden on the patient. Neurosurgery central
nervous system infections are a group of infections that occur within
the skull and spinal canal with an incidence of 4.6%–25% (46). The
pathogenic organisms include gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive
bacteria, and fungi, with the former two being predominant (47). In the
event of a suspected central nervous system infection, it is imperative
that samples such as cerebrospinal ﬂuid are collected for testing prior to
the administration of any antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, empirical
antimicrobial therapy should be initiated without delay (48, 49).
Antimicrobials are the preferred treatment option over fungicides
that can readily cross the blood–brain barrier, such as ceftriaxone,
cefotaxime, meropenem, and vancomycin. Infections caused by
methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus can be treated with
ampicillin/sulbactam. Despite its unfavorable pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic proﬁle, vancomycin is currently recommended as
a ﬁrst-line agent for methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections. For the
treatment of third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible Gram-
negative bacillus infections, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is
05


recommended; for Pseudomonas spp. strains, cefepime, ceftazidime, or
meropenem is recommended. It is further recommended that
preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis should target the bacteria
most likely to cause an infection, rather than killing all organisms
(50). It is also important to note that routine and continuous
prophylactic use of antimicrobials does not reduce the incidence of
intracranial infections; rather, it increases the risk of drug-resistant
strains of bacteria (51).
## Conclusion
The advent of advanced medical imaging techniques has enabled
early diagnosis of meningiomas, prior to the onset of symptoms.
Nevertheless, some patients may not be diagnosed until their tumor
is at an advanced stage, by which time their symptoms may have
persisted for years or have been previously misdiagnosed as other
conditions. The risk of complete resection is elevated for giant
meningiomas, because they frequently inﬁltrate crucial regions of the
brain and are intricately linked to vital neurovascular structures. The
surgical procedures employed to remove these tumors are particularly
challenging for several reasons, including limited visual ﬁeld, increased
brain edema, high tumor vascularization, and potential need for
extensive craniotomies. Furthermore, patients with larger
meningiomas exhibit a higher incidence of peritumoral edema than
patients with smaller tumors. The utilization of ﬂuorescence-guided
surgery in meningioma surgery can facilitate dissection of the tumor
interface through clear visualization of adjacent vascular and neural
structures. In critical areas of the brain, where cerebral edema is
exacerbated and tumor necrosis is poorly demarcated from the
cortex, the tumor can be resected as much as possible while
protecting the blood vessels and nerves. The resection can also be
combined with preoperative embolization in patients with large tumors
or meningiomas with abundant vascularization. The present case
corroborates the value of ﬂuorescence-guided surgery in such
procedures, illustrating its beneﬁts in maximizing tumor resection
while safeguarding the normal brain tissue.
